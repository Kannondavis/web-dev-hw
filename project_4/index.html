        <p>Hi, I am Kannon and welcome to my stuff. The intent of this site is to give you a doorway into my mind, so you can
          see what I like, what I don't, and other weird things that just spark my interest. Be sure to check out all the pages
          as it is experience meant to be seen start to finish.<br> <br>

        The current homepage highlight is <strong>summer beers</strong>, with the weather finally getting hotter it is time for
        refreshing beers. What I like in a summer beer is something with strong citrus notes, a bit or tartness, and something that
        still taste good even when the sun is starting to warm it up. Here are my recommendations <strong>Draught Works - Pineapple
        express</strong>, <strong>KettleHouse - Fish On!</strong>, and <strong>Big Sky Brewing - Summer Honey</strong>. Every one
        of these beers is great and deserves a taste. Below you will see my choice for beer of the summer.</p>
