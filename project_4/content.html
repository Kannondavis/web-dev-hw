        <p>This first thing that im going to explore is the <strong>EDM (Electronic Dance Music) scene</strong>
        while im relatively new to this music, I've been listening for a little over three years now. I have some
        stuff to say about it, this music literally has something for everyone whether you want something chill to study
        or fall asleep to, or you want to moshpit and put your body on the line, the broad genre has something for everybody.
        Not only is the music a great reason to start listening, but the community is even more of a reason, they provide a
        caring and judgement free place for anyone who wants to be involved. Living by the policy of <i>PLUR (Peace,love,unity,
        respect)</i> this is the one of two rules, the other being be true to yourself. Still not convinced then let me cap
        my rant off with talking about the concerts and festivals, for every concert the production value is insane, it is always
        worth every penny. Festivals are on another level, do you ever wish you could recapture the worder that you had as a child,
        if see go to a EDM festival you will not be dissapointed. <br>
        PLEASE LISTEN TO THESE SONGS EACH IS AMAZING IN THEIR OWN WAY
