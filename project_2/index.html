    <h1>Throwing A Disc</h1>
    <h2>Form</h2>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <img src="images/form_1.jpg" alt="beginning form" height="400px" width="600px">
    <pre>Throwing a disc effectively begins with your form. The start of good form is your stance,
    to begin put feet slightly wider than should width (ensure that you have good hip mobility).
    a stance as seen in the above picture will be your foundation for all long throws moving foward.</pre> <br>

    <h3>Step 2</h3>

    <pre>The second step in throwing a disc is how to position your arm and head. Your arm closest to
      the target will come straight across your chest level. Your head will look back at your disc, this
      may feel counter intuitive but it is important for a great regular throw. We will touch on this
      more in the next step, ensuring that you bring the disc staight accross your chest rather than a curve
      away will make your throws more accurate.</pre> <br>

    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <img src="images/form_3.jpg" alt="final form" height="400px" width="600px">
    <pre>The final step ties this all together, as you are "pulling" the disc accross your chest
    follow it with your head. While simutaniously stepping forward with the same leg as the side you throw
    with. Also puch off with the opposite foot, this will make for great power transfer and your disc
    will fly further. A quick tip is if your disc banks off to the left really hard when you don't want it
    too focus on releaesing at a flatter angle.</pre>
