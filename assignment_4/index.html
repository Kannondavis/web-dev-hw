         <pre>I have a mansion, forget the price
              Ain't never been there, they tell me it's nice
              I live in hotels, tear out the walls
              I have accountants pay for it all
              They say I'm crazy but I have a good time
              I'm just looking for clues at the scene of the crime
              Life's been good to me so far
              My Maserati does one-eighty-five
              I lost my license, now I don't drive
              I have a limo, ride in the back
              I lock the doors in case I'm attacked
              I'm makin' records, my fans they can't wait
              They write me letters, tell me I'm great
              So I got me an office, gold records on the wall
              Just leave a message, maybe I'll call
              Lucky I'm sane after all I've been through
              (Everybody say, "I'm cool, " "He's cool")
              I can't complain but sometimes I still do
              Life's been good to me so far
              I go to parties sometimes until four
              It's hard to leave when you can't find the door
              It's tough to handle this fortune and fame
              Everybody's so different, I haven't changed
              They say I'm lazy but it takes all my time
              (Everybody say, "Oh yeah, " "Oh yeah")
              I keep on goin' guess I'll never know why
              Life's been good to me so far
              Ah, yeah, yeah</pre>
