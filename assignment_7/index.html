        <center> We live together, we act on, and react to, one another; but always and in all circumstances we are
by ourselves. The martyrs go hand in hand into the arena; they are crucified alone. Embraced, the lovers
desperately try to fuse their insulated ecstasies into a single self-transcendence; in vain. By its very
nature every embodied spirit is doomed to suffer and enjoy in solitude. Sensations, feelings, insights,
fancies - all these are private and, except through symbols and at second hand, incommunicable. We
can pool information about experiences, but never the experiences themselves. From family to nation,
every human group is a society of island universes. Most island universes are sufficiently like one another
to Permit of inferential understanding or even of mutual empathy or "feeling into." Thus, remembering our
own bereavements and humiliations, we can condole with others in analogous circumstances, can put
ourselves (always, of course, in a slightly Pickwickian sense) in their places. But in certain cases
communication between universes is incomplete or even nonexistent. The mind is its own place, and the
Places inhabited by the insane and the exceptionally gifted are so different from the places where
ordinary men and women live, that there is little or no common ground of memory to serve as a basis for
understanding or fellow feeling. Words are uttered, but fail to enlighten. The things and events to which
the symbols refer belong to mutually exclusive realms of experience.
        To see ourselves as others see us is a most salutary gift. Hardly less important is the capacity to see
others as they see themselves. But what if these others belong to a different species and inhabit a
radically alien universe? For example, how can the sane get to know what it actually feels like to be
mad? Or, short of being born again as a visionary, a medium, or a musical genius, how can we ever visit
the worlds which, to Blake, to Swedenborg, to Johann Sebastian Bach, were home? And how can a
man at the extreme limits of ectomorphy and cerebrotonia ever put himself in the place of one at the
limits of endomorphy and viscerotonia, or, except within certain circumscribed areas, share the feelings
of one who stands at the limits of mesomorphy and somatotonia? To the unmitigated behaviorist such
questions, I suppose, are meaningless. But for those who theoretically believe what in practice they
know to be true - namely, that there is an inside to experience as well as an outside - the problems
posed are real problems, all the more grave for being, some completely insoluble, some soluble only in
exceptional circumstances and by methods not available to everyone. Thus, it seems virtually certain that
I shall never know what it feels like to be Sir John Falstaff or Joe Louis.</center> <br>
